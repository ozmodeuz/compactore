This is a small data pack that adds compacting recipes for Asurine, Crimsite, Ochrum, and Veridium to Create Fabric. These recipes are similar to the recipe for compacting Andesite from flint, gravel, and lava, and are intended to add a medium-cost entrypoint for automating the production of copper, gold, iron, and zinc ingots. Yields of nuggets from these four blocks vary, so some of the recipes are more effective than others.
